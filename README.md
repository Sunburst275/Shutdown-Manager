# Shutdown Manager
A program which allows you to dicate the on-/and offtime of your PC by settings schedules. Outside of the specified ontime, your PC will be shut down.
Its built with C++ and the Qt- Framework, and thus completely free to use and to alter, but please refer to me when making any changes or something.

To download the working executable, see [the download section of my website](https://sunburst275.jimdofree.com/software/shutdown-monitor/download/).
